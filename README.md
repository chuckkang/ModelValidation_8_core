# modelvalidation_8_core
simple form with model validations and httphelper classes in asp net core mvc

this will use the simple registration form.  Instead of using separate variables in the IACTIONRESULT method (string firstname, string lastname), pass the backend model in as the argument ie(UserModel newUser).
